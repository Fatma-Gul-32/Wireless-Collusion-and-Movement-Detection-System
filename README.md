# Wireless Collusion & Movement Detection System

## Introduction

### Project Definition
This project aims to develop a Wireless Collusion & Movement Detection System to enhance vehicle security. It uses interconnected devices and software to protect vehicles from unauthorized access and security threats via communication technology.

### Purpose and Importance
The primary goal is to improve vehicle security. The system includes a special sensor that detects anomalies, and the PCB and Web Server communicate wirelessly for continuous monitoring. This solution features alarms to deter intruders, real-time notifications to the owner, and precise event timing.

### Innovation and Originality
The project is unique due to its complete in-house development. Every component, from the PCB schematic to the software, has been designed and implemented from scratch, ensuring seamless integration and a fully self-developed, innovative security system.

### Related Works
While many existing vehicle security systems exist, this project stands out with its comprehensive design. Unlike other projects focusing on specific aspects, it integrates sensors, wireless technology, IoT, and real-time data for a holistic security solution.

## Project Description
The system comprises two main components: a Master PCB and a Web Server. The Master PCB, equipped with an accelerometer sensor, communicates wirelessly with the Web Server. In case of collusion or movement, the system activates a buzzer, sends notifications to the owner, and provides Real-Time Clock (RTC) data along with acceleration data, offering a robust security solution.

### Problem Requirements
The project addresses several key vehicle security challenges:

Stopping Unauthorized Access: Prevents unauthorized access to vehicles.
Constant Monitoring: Ensures continuous surveillance to detect unusual movements or threats.
Quick Reactions: Provides rapid response mechanisms, including alarms and real-time notifications.
User-Friendliness: Ensures the system is easy to use, with clear messages for vehicle owners.
Hardware-Software Integration: Ensures seamless interaction between physical components, the MCU, and the Web Server.
